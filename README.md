# Text generator
The text generator based on the Markov Chain algorithm. The Python 3 script generates a pseudo random text based on arrangement of words in an another text.

  - [RU](https://tproger.ru/translations/markov-chains/)

#### Note: this implementation of the Markov Chain is case-sensitive and punctuation-sensitive.

## Features
  - generation of a pseudo random text.
  - work with a files.


## Installation
The easiest way to get started is download the this repository.

```python
from markov_chain import MarkovChain

chain = MarkovChain()
chain.init(["One fish two fish red fish blue fish."])
chain.create()
print(chain.generate())
```

For a satisfactory result, a large text base is needed. You can use [this](https://yadi.sk/d/dM1Ogbav3MrXZv) text base or create your own.


## Guide
For full understanding, I recommend reading the resources that were given above. Now I will briefly describe the logic of the program.

#### Generation logic
During generation, a next word is selected based on a previous word. In the sentence "One fish two fish red fish blue fish." after a "fish" word goes the next words: "two", "red", "blue". So, after a "fish" will be selected one of this words with a chance 1/3. Suppose that the "blue" word was selected. What word goes after the "blue"? Yes, the "fish." word! (Note: "fish" != "fish."). So, the next word is the "fish.". That goes after the "fish."? After the "fish." the text is ends and nothing more. So, the chance of finish the text is 1/1 or 100%.

You can trace this sequence yourself:
```python
"*START* One fish two fish red fish blue fish. *END* *TEXT_END*"

{'One': ['fish'], '*END*': ['*TEXT_END*'], 'two': ['fish'], '*START*': ['One'], 'fish': ['two', 'red', 'blue'], 'red': ['fish'], 'blue': ['fish.'], 'fish.': ['*END*']}
```

#### Window
A "window" is actually count of previous words. The last example was a one-window chain. In the sentence "One fish two fish red fish blue fish." after the "fish red" word goes the next word: "fish". After the "red fish": "blue" -> "fish blue": "fish.", "blue fish." -> text is ends.

The higher a number of windows, the higher a correctness of generation. Correctness is a meaning of a sentence.

You can trace this sequence yourself:
```python
"*START* One fish two fish red fish blue fish. *END* *TEXT_END*"

{'*START* One': ['fish'], 'fish two': ['fish'], 'fish red': ['fish'], 'blue fish.': ['*END*'], 'fish. *END*': ['*TEXT_END*'], 'fish blue': ['fish.'], 'red fish': ['blue'], 'two fish': ['red'], 'One fish': ['two'], '*START*': ['One fish']}
```

## Examples of right usage

#### Basic usage

```python
from markov_chain import MarkovChain

chain = MarkovChain("Simple test MarkovChain instance")
chain.init(["One fish two fish red fish blue fish."])
chain.create()
print(chain.generate())
```

#### Instance arguments

```python
from markov_chain import MarkovChain

chain = MarkovChain("Hard test MarkovChain instance", window=2)
chain.init(["Today you are you. That is truer than true. There is no one alive who is you-er than you."])
chain.create()
print(chain.generate())
```

#### Generation arguments

```python
from markov_chain import MarkovChain

chain = MarkovChain("Insane test MarkovChain instance")
chain.init(["You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own.", "The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places youll go."])
chain.create()
print(chain.generate(start="You", max_words=10))
```

#### JSON/PICKLE/SQLITE File

```python
from markov_chain import MarkovChain, extensions

chain = MarkovChain()
test_json = extensions.file.json.read("markov_chain/examples/common/text.json")
chain.init(test_json["text"]["simple"])
chain.create()
print(chain.generate())
extensions.file.json.save(chain.chain, "test_json.json")
```

#### SQLiteFile Instance

```python
from markov_chain import extensions

chain = extensions.file.SQLiteFile(path="test_sqlite.sqlite")
print(chain.generate())
```

#### JSON from the [text base](https://yadi.sk/d/dM1Ogbav3MrXZv)

```python
from markov_chain import MarkovChain, extensions

chain = MarkovChain()
text = extensions.file.json.read("pr.json")
chain.init(text["messages"])
chain.create()
print(chain.generate())
```


## Examples of wrong usage

#### Case-sensitive

```python
from markov_chain import MarkovChain

chain = MarkovChain("Hard test MarkovChain instance")
chain.init(["Today you are you. That is truer than true. There is no one alive who is you-er than you."])
chain.create()
print(chain.generate(start="You"))
```
      
#### Number of the start words != number of the windows

```python
from markov_chain import MarkovChain

chain = MarkovChain("Hard test MarkovChain instance", window=2)
chain.init(["Today you are you. That is truer than true. There is no one alive who is you-er than you."])
chain.create()
print(chain.generate(start="You"))
```
